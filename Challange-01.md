## Instructions

 - in this challange you are required to run a redis docker image.
 - recall that Redis is combined of the redis server and a CLI tool that ships with the redis binaries.
 - your goal is to add several keys to redis and use a small program that prints those values.
 - you can use the Docker Hub Redis Readme that has all the instructions needed for this task :
